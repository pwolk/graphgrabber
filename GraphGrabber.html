<P>GraphGrabber is a simple program to obtain coordinates/data from a scanned 
image or graph.<BR>This text is the entire manual; below is the link to download 
the program.</P>
<P><B>About GraphGrabber</B><BR>GraphGrabber is a simple program to determine 
the coordinates of points in a bitmap. It has been designed with the aim to load 
a scanned chart, define the horizontal and vertical axis, and then determine the 
values for data points in the chart. Yet it can be used for any type of 
determining coordinates in an image. </P>
<P><B>Installation:</B><BR>Place the program in a directory you see fit. The 
program has no registry settings, drivers or otherwise that need to be installed 
elsewhere. Some settings are stored in a configuration (graphgrabber.ini) file. 
If you delete this file, the program will make a new one the next time the 
program is started. </P>
<P><B>Operation:</B><BR>Load a bitmap. Define the first coordinate axis (x-axis) 
by drawing a line, starting at the origin. Move the mouse pointer to the origin, press
the left button down, keep it pressed, and drag along the x-axis to the end point of the axis, after 
which the button can be released.
<br>
Define the second axis (y-axis) by 
clicking the end point of the y-axis. The drawing of the line is automatic.
<br>
Define the numerical value of the origin and the end points in the panel 
on the top. Axes need not be perpendicular, nor need the image be aligned to 
the window. You can change the axes by repeating this procedure. Once your axes 
are at the right location, click the 'Grab Data' tab, and then click on the 
points of which you want to know the coordinates.<BR><BR>Some default settings 
may be changed by editing the GraphGrabber.ini file, such as default open- and 
savedirectory, default numerical values for the axes, and the format of the 
output of coordinates. Good luck. </P>
<P><B>Shortcuts:</B><BR>&lt;ctrl&gt; + d = delete all data<BR>&lt;ctrl&gt; + c = 
copy data to clipboard<BR>&lt;ctrl&gt; + t = toggle tabs</P>

<FONT size=2>0.31 release</FONT></B><FONT size=2>
(27-09-00):<BR>Small changes: removed the delete-key response since it is prone 
to accidents.</FONT></P><FONT size=2><B>0.30 release</FONT></B><FONT size=2> 
(11-07-00):<BR>Major bugfix for the offset of the axes when not logarithmic. 
Added more shortcuts and correct response to &lt;delete&gt; key in the grabbed 
data.</FONT>
